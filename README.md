# Queue-BinarySearch
Queue implementation with Binary Search and Linear Search in Python
Instructions for GitHub README:
How to Run:

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., queue_search.py).
Run the file using a Python interpreter (e.g., python queue_search.py).
Follow the prompts to input queue elements and search items.
Purpose:

Demonstrates a queue implementation with enqueue, dequeue, binary search, and linear search functionalities.
Time Complexity:

Binary Search: O(log n), worst-case for large data is log(n) comparisons.
Linear Search: O(n), worst-case is n comparisons.
